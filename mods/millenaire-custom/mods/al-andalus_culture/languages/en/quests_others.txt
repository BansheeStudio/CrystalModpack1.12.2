artisanwine_0_label=Thirsty!

operation_0_label=A gruesome operation
operation_0_description=Ah, $name! Can a friend ask a favor? A patient is in dire need of an arm amputation but he hid my axe in fear. What's worse is that this man is the local blacksmith so I can't even get a new axe. Would you happen to have one with you? 
operation_0_description_success=Thank you very much, dear friend. Now I'm afraid the village won't be so happy about this transaction of ours so it's only fair that I give you a generous sum of money. Don't feel so down, this is all in the name of science!

To make matters worse, they stole a compendium containing invaluable knowledge about the new world. I had already paid the caravan for their losses but that book is something I cannot replace. If you are able to retrieve this item, I will give you permission to keep their stolen goods. Do we have a deal?
